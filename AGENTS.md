# Agent Instructions

This project uses **kata** for issue tracking. Run `kata quickstart` to get started.

## Project Scale Context

- **User count and tool type:** Small developer-facing library and CLI for dice notation parsing, rolling, and simulation.
- **Codebase size and complexity:** Compact Rust workspace with a core crate plus CLI and Python bindings; prefer direct, readable changes over framework-heavy abstractions.
- **Process overhead expectations:** Use kata for durable task tracking and tests for behavior changes; keep design artifacts and review proportional to a small library.
- **Default approach:** Pragmatic, minimal, and API-stability-conscious. Add extensibility only when it preserves a clear public boundary.

## Quick Reference

```bash
kata ready            # Find available (unblocked) work
kata show <ref>       # View issue details
kata claim <ref>      # Claim work atomically
kata close <ref> --done --message "..."  # Complete verified work
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## kata issue tracker

This project uses [kata](https://github.com/kenn-io/kata) as its shared issue
ledger. Run `kata quickstart` at the start of each session for the full agent
contract. The short version:

- Search before creating: `kata search "<keywords>" --agent`.
- Prefer updating existing issues over duplicates (`kata comment`, `kata label add`, `kata edit`).
- Default to `--agent` for ordinary reads and mutations; use `--json` only when a script needs structured data.
- Close only verified work: `kata close <ref> --done --message "<scope + verification>" --commit <sha>`.
- If work is incomplete, label `needs-review` and comment what remains rather than closing.
- Never `kata delete` or `kata purge` without explicit user authorization.

## kata work.* conventions (agent orchestration)

When working a kata-tracked issue, keep its `work.*` metadata truthful
(see docs/operations/agent-orchestration.md for the full recipe):

- On claim/start: `kata meta set <ref> work.attention ok`; if the work has a
  dedicated branch, stamp it once with `kata meta set <ref> work.branch <branch>`.
- Signal live state: `kata meta set <ref> work.attention stuck|needs-human|ok`
  plus a one-line `work.attention_msg` saying why. Raise `stuck` when you cannot
  proceed, `needs-human` when you want review; clear back to `ok` when unblocked.
- Never stop with the signal stale: close the issue, or leave the attention
  pair reflecting the hand-off.
- Coordinators read `work.*` on issues they delegated; only the working agent
  writes them. `work.*` on closed issues is meaningless.
